I completed my surgical residency in Assiut University Hospitals. I moved to the UK in 1997 and obtained my FRCS and pursued a career in Transplantation &amp; Hepatobiliary Surgery. I started as a research fellow in the Department of Transplantation &amp; Hepatobiliary Surgery and University of Leeds. My research topic was organ preservation for Transplantation. I obtained an MD degree from the University of Leeds in 2002. I completed my training in General Surgery and subsequently focused my training in Transplantation &amp; Hepatobiliary Surgery. My main interest is Liver Transplantation in adults and pediatrics and Hepatobiliary Surgery. I started as a consultant in 2008 at Leeds Teaching Hospitals and I was the head of the Department of Transplantation &amp; Hepatobiliary Surgery for 11 years. After stepping down as a Head of Department in November 2020, I am currently the Program Lead for Living Donor Liver Transplantation in the unit. My areas of expertise include liver transplantation (adult, pediatric and living donor), Hepatobiliary surgery and general and laparoscopic surgery. I have research interests in normothermic machine perfusion, organ preservation techniques and immunosuppression trials, and functional MRI scans for assessment of liver volumetry.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1661172001791{margin-bottom: 20px !important;background-color: #e2efff !important;}&#8221; el_class=&#8221;SPRow SPRowFull&#8221;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8074&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Magdy Attia, MD, MS, FRCSGen&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%231e73be&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:900%20bold%20regular%3A900%3Anormal&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1661171926706{margin-top: 0px !important;margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]Consultant Hepatobiliary and Transplantation Surgeon Leeds Teaching Hospitals[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Biography&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h5|text_align:left|color:%231e73be&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:900%20bold%20regular%3A900%3Anormal&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1661171919370{margin-top: 0px !important;margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]I received my Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees in 1991 from Assiut University Medical School in Assiut, Egypt.
